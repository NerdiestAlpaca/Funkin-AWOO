:edie:Good show! Though you could've used a little more pizzazz...
:boyfriend:Eh???
:roxie:Don't worry about Edie. She's very particular...
:boyfriend:Doobeepa...
:roxie:Now I can't help but feel like we've been forgetting something...
:bev:More like someONE, Roxie.
:roxie:Oh! Bev, there you are!
:bev:I've been here the whole time, actually, watching from the sidelines.
:bev:You just couldn't see me,
:bev:because I was conveniently seated in such a way that hid me from the camera.
:roxie:(What camera, Bev?)
:bev:(I don't know, I just feel like there is one.)
:roxie:(Gotcha...)
:bev:ANYWAY.
:bev:I've been watching all of your singing, Mr. Boyfriend.
:bev:You're a good singer, and a fast one too, but how LONG can you go?
:roxie:Oooh! A challenge for Boyfriend! Fun.
:boyfriend:Ba-deeBOO!!!
