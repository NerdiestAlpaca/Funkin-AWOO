:jade:Roxie?
:roxie:Eep!
:roxie:Oh phew, it's just you. Hi Jade!
:jade:Why'd you bring the blue-haired human-thing back here--
:roxie:H-he just wanted to visit...
:jade:Roxie, let me finish.
:jade:Why'd you bring him back here without telling me?
:jade:I wanted to sing with him before but my scheduled nap got in the way.
:roxie:Oh! Go ahead Jade!
:roxie:I thought you were mad at me or something...
:jade:Nah. It's no big deal. 
:jade:I talked to the Mayor about it and he's even letting the little dude have his own Paw-tucket key.
:roxie:Woah!
:boyfriend:Key?
:roxie:Yeah! Your key will let you visit Paw-tucket whenever you want!
:roxie:I guess you're our guest of honor now, huh?
:boyfriend:Neat!
:gf:Oh that's sweet!
:jade:Anyway. Let's get singing, pal.
:boyfriend:Alright!
